    "# Implementing DCGANs in Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "Paper that described the type of DCGAN that we will create in this module. [[Cite:radford2015unsupervised]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) This paper implements a DCGAN as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* No pre-processing was applied to training images besides scaling to the range of the tanh activation function [-1, 1]. \n",
    "* All models were trained with mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a mini-batch size of 128. \n",
    "* All weights were initialized from a zero-centered Normal distribution with standard deviation 0.02. \n",
    "* In the LeakyReLU, the slope of the leak was set to 0.2 in all models.\n",
    "* we used the Adam optimizer(Kingma & Ba, 2014) with tuned hyperparameters. We found the suggested learning rate of 0.001, to be too high, using 0.0002 instead. \n",
    "* Additionally, we found leaving the momentum term $\\beta{1}$ at the suggested value of 0.9 resulted in training oscillation and instability while reducing it to 0.5 helped stabilize training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper also provides the following architecture guidelines for stable Deep Convolutional GANs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Replace any pooling layers with strided convolutions (discriminator) and fractional-strided convolutions (generator).\n",
    "* Use batchnorm in both the generator and the discriminator.\n",
    "* Remove fully connected hidden layers for deeper architectures.\n",
    "* Use ReLU activation in generator for all layers except for the output, which uses Tanh.\n",
    "* Use LeakyReLU activation in the discriminator for all layers.\n",
